* Make sure you install [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) unless you're okay with installing these gems globally.
* Enter and follow on-screen instructions
	```bash
	rvm use .
	```
* enter 
	```bask
	gem install bundler && bundle install
	```
* finally you can run the script!
	```bash
	./data_scrape.rb
	```

###Caveats
the file path assumes you have the data exported (you can find backups of it in  _Data:\\_ DS Data Backups directory) and live flat with the project directory. Let Vincent know if you need any help with this.
