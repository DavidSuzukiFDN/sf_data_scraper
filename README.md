#DSF Data Scraper!

Scrape all the things!

![all the
things](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/567408/gifs/x-all-the-things-template.png)

* Make sure you install [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) unless you're okay with installing these gems globally.
* Enter and follow on-screen instructions
```rvm use . ```
* enter ```gem install bundler && bundle install```
* finally you can run the script! ```./data_scrape.rb```

------------------------------

###Caveats
the file path assumes you have the data exported (you can find backups of it in  _Data_ DS Data Backups directory) and live flat with the project directory. Let Vincent know if you need any help with this.
